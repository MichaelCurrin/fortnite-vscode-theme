# Fortnite VS Code Theme

![Banner](./banner.png)

üêî Are you a child at heart? Do you like enjoying yourself, even while writing serious business logic? If you like taking a flame bow and igniting data structures on fire, this is the theme for you.

üèπ Enjoy it before I get a cease and desist!

This theme is inspired by Fortnite, which is a game that's basically like the Hunger Games set at children's birthday party in the middle of a fever dream. But more fun. Very cathartic for those of us in the tech industry.

Enjoy! ‚ú®
